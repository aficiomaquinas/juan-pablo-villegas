MX, 1986

My work has developed from thinking about filmmaking, as a way to bring together my interest in images and sound. It takes as a starting point the body perception of external stimuli and how that influences our personal and collective experience. The tools I use are derived from audiovisual principles that allow reflection by changing the way they are conventionally used. In recent years, I have researched issues related to translation and the expansion of the sensory spectrum, the animist condition of objects, and the formation of the psychosomatic.
