_D'après le Jardin_ is a sound installation presented at the botanical garden of Tourcoing, FR, in which the visitors are invited to navigate the space with headphones and specially programmed devices. Along the journey, they listen to five audio tracks that reunite Villega’s recent research about the co-relationship between nature and culture. The resulting interplay of sound and space invites the spectator to reflect on the continuous exchange between the individual and its environment.
