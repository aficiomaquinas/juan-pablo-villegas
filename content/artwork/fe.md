Fe -the chemical symbol for iron from the Latin ferratum, but also the Spanish word for faith- proposes a twisted act of belief. Metal has no organic life, however we assume that what we see and hear relates to a familiar realm. Unaware of the magnetic field that provokes the grated iron to move and thus generate sound, we project life into an inanimate object that appears to crawl, to squeal.
