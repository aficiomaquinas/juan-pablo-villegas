Fe -the chemical symbol for iron from the Latin ferratum, but also the Spanish word for faith- proposes a twisted act of belief. Metal has no organic life, however we assume that what we see and hear relates to a familiar realm. Unaware of the magnetic field that provokes the iron to move and thus generate sound, we project life into an inanimate object that appears to crawl, to squeal.
