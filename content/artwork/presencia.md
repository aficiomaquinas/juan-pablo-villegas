_Presencia_ is a project based on the connections between matter-energy and object-context. Addressing the body as a mutable being constructed by material and immaterial relationships, I made a video and a performance in collaboration with the dancer Stephanie Janaina, showing the symbiotic exchange that occurs between the being and its environment. While the body modifies itâ€™s form the territory is reconstructed, and vice versa.
