We perceive color in fragments that oscillate between light and darkness, in a process that gives shape and consistency to our environment. Umbra investigates the way we interpret the qualities of color as a mentally constructed relationship mediated by subjectivity. The segments of Umbra establish a framework of relationships in which "the visible‚Äù is a mental elaboration that mixes the concrete and the abstract.

Filtre is a sculpture in which a beam of white light is projected onto a marble disk, the white is formed by the mixture of three lights (red, green and blue) concentrated with a lens. The spectator is invited to project the shadow of his hands on the marble and to discover the colours contained in the rays.

In a second moment, through the documentation of the work the technical process is revealed. What we perceive in the exhibition space seems to direct the reading of the work, but it is through the documentation when the aesthetic phenomenon is completed.

Gamme is a series of photographs in which I registered different shades of magenta using a process similar to the "autochrome". Magenta is an extra spectral color, meaning that it does not exist within the visible human spectrum and is formed in the brain, by mixing the two limits : red and blue.

Claire-Obscure is a video that explores the impossibility of seeing light in the absence of matter. In its realization I documented the light rays of a 35 mm projector. The sound is a translation from color to sound, scaling the wavelength of each color to the audible range.
