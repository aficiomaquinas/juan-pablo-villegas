There is no natural beauty, nature is made beautiful before our eyes through art. Ocres is a piece that addresses the theme of the landscape as a process filtered by the culture and aesthetics values, for which I made a triptych of photographs of a mine of natural pigments and with the minerals of the land I made a palette of watercolours.
