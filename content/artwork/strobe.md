_Strobe_ is an audio-visual performance consisting of one stroboscopic light connected to a sequencer.Â  The intention is to cause psycho-physical effects in response to repetition and rhythmic patterns of sound and light. One of the psychosomatic consequences implicated is the apparition of phantasmagorical images in the viewer's mind.
