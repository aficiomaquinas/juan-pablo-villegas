The Purge was the title of the research project that took place at the Museo de Arte Moderno (MAM) in Mexico City. I investigated the theme of the the uncanny as a will to unravel aspects of architecture, archive, bureaucracy and interaction with the public space. La Purga  questioned how subjectivity appropriates a place under strict control as museum.
