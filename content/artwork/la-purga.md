_The Purge_ was the title of the research project that took place at the Museo de Arte Moderno (MAM) in Mexico City. I investigated the theme of the the uncanny as a will to unravel aspects of architecture, archive, bureaucracy and interaction with the public space. _La Purga_ questioned how subjectivity appropriates a place under strict control as a museum.

To close the show I decided to carry out the action of burning a portrait of myself painted by Manuel Mathar. After six months of work, the performance attempted a personal liberation of the regulatory system governing my actions inside the institution.
