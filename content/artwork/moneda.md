I acquired an archive of 8 mm films and 35 mm slides (about 30 kg of this material), consisting of images of archaeological pre-hispanic ruins and colonial buildings from various places in Mexico that had previously been used to illustrate various classes at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México (UNAM). I worked to extract the silver contained in the film in the form of silver nitrate, using different chemical processes. As the original images disappeared, I documented the residue. Using the extracted silver, I did a mirror. This gesture echoes the deep ties between the extraction of precious metals and the historical and economic structure of the Americas. It involves the physical transformation of images with the intention of generating a material reflection of our environment as determined by value and exchange. Mirror as an image.

The video installation Moneda consists of three videos displayed under a glass floor through which you can see the vestiges of the Ex Convent of San Jeronimo; a silver mirror mounted on a carousel that revolves around the gallery and a publication printed with movable types.
