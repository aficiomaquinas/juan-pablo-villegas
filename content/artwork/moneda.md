<div>{{&lt; vimeo 117913430 vimeo &gt;}}</div>

<span style="font-size: 1rem;">I acquired an archive of 8 mm films and 35 mm slides (about 30 kg of this material), consisting of images of archaeological prehispanic ruins and colonial buildings from various places in Mexico that had previously been used to illustrate various classes at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).</span>

I worked to extract the silver contained in the film in the form of silver nitrate, using different chemical processes. As the original images disappeared, I documented the residue. Using the extracted silver, I did a mirror.

This gesture echoes the deep ties between the extraction of precious metals and the historical and economic structure of the Americas. It involves the physical transformation of images with the intention of generating a material reflection of our environment as determined by value and exchange. Mirror as an image.
