I acquired an archive of 8 mm films and 35 mm slides (about 30 kg of this material), consisting of images of archaeological pre-hispanic ruins and colonial buildings from various places in Mexico. I worked to extract the silver contained in the film in the form of silver nitrate, using different chemical processes. As the original images disappeared, I documented the residue. Using the extracted silver, I did a mirror.

The video installation Moneda consists of three videos displayed under a glass floor through which you can see the vestiges of the Ex Convent of San Jeronimo; a silver mirror mounted on a carousel that revolves around the gallery and a publication printed with movable types.
