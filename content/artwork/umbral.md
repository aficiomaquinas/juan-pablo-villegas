Ventana is a project in which the limits of manâ€™s perception are questioned, using the daguerreotype as a means to reflect on the ranges of light that can be perceived. The daguerreotype is only sensitive to the range of ultraviolet light, a spectrum that for us is invisible, based on this principle, a translucent camera was produced, it filters the ranges that affect the plate but allow us to see its interior while the image is being produced.
