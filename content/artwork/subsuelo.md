While memory develops during traumatic events, subjectivity adjusts to our psychological experience. The series of photographs in Subsoil consists of images altered by the recording of the vibration of an earthquake. As the earthquake intensifies, the distortion of the image increases. Subsuelo employs the antique photographic process of collodion or wet plate, in which the emulsion must remain liquid in order to make the image. The process consists in placing the emulsion on the plate, making the exposure and then subjecting it to a vibration equivalent to the data collected during the earthquake.
