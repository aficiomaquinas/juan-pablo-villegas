![](/uploads/2018/10/13/sonambulo_1.jpg)Sleepwalker is an action that translates the fixed image of a painting to that of movement in film and displays on site the soundtrack made up of music, effects, voice, direct sound and subtitles. The intention is to show the expansive dimension of sound to break with the aesthetic of the two-dimensional image.
